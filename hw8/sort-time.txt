Part IV 

Is your mergesort always stable?  Explain why or why not.
  No, because when you merge two items and enqueue it back to the queue, the order of items with the same key might have changed. An example: 3’ 4 5 3’’ 2, after mergesort: 2 3’’ 3’ 4 5

Is your quicksort always stable?  Explain why or why not.
  Yes, because the order of items with the same key is preserved in qEqual.
